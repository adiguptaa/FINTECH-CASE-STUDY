Mack Flavelle - Cheif Creative Officer (CryptoKitties)

###### The Beginning ######

CEO Roham Gharegozlou left his stable biotech Ph.D. at Stanford to try his hand at technology in 2012, identifying the niche of cryptocurrency and decentralized blockchain development. This niche was appealing due to the lack of competition and the ability to innovate freely. He noticed that existing digital assets were non-fungible but lacked room for growth and development. He started setting the standard in the young industry with his first successful idea, CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based virtual game operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Users were able to buy, sell, breed, and collect unique digital cats represented as non-fungible tokens, each with a distinct and tradable digital asset. The game gained popularity for introducing the concept of digital scarcity and ownership through blockchain technology, paving the way for the broader adoption of NFTs. After this success, the company expanded its horizon and landed a deal with the NBA to create a massively successful NFT project known as NBA Top Shots. Since then, they have collaborated with major companies such as Disney and the NFL, released their own blockchain environment 'Flow', all while remaining a dominant player in the cryptocurrency and blockchain development space.

Dapper Labs has raised a total of $612.5M through 7 rounds of funding, primarily from large private venture funds who want to diversify into the FinTech space. Additionally, Dapper Labs has raised $725M in a venture fund known as the “ecosystem fund,” the largest ecosystem backing of its kind. The fund will go towards boosting “gaming, infrastructure, decentralized finance, content, and creators” specifically on their blockchain, the Flow ecosystem.

##### Business Activities #####

Through projects like CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot, Dapper Labs aims to explore and pioneer the use of blockchain technology for creating unique digital assets (NFTs) and innovative ways of engaging users in the gaming and collectibles space. It is not solving a problem in need of change but instead pioneering the next natural evolution in the gaming space. Furthermore, Flow is a blockchain designed for extensive scaling, providing fast and low-cost transactions that make sense for DApps such as NFT marketplaces and crypto-infused video games. This will help combat one of the most troublesome parts of cryptocurrencies: the expensive gas fees caused during periods of high trading volume.

The company's customer base includes gamers, collectors, investors, and sports enthusiasts interested in owning and trading digital assets securely on the blockchain. The market size for these customers has expanded rapidly as interest in NFTs and blockchain-based collectibles has grown with practical use cases. Their customer base continues to grow as Web3 applications become more apparent to the masses. Additionally, Dapper Labs provides tools and platforms that appeal to developers and creators interested in building DApps and experiences on the blockchain beyond gaming.

Dapper Labs' unfair advantage lies in being one of the early movers and innovators in the blockchain gaming and NFT space. The success of CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot has established the company as a leader in creating blockchain-based experiences with mass appeal. Furthermore, larger companies are more likely to work with them because of their established success. Due to this head start, they have since worked with the likes of the NFL and Disney with many more collaborations to come.

In order to support all of these platforms and user experiences, there is a lot of technology on the backend. Dapper Labs utilizes blockchain technology, with a focus on its own Flow blockchain. The company employs smart contracts for creating and managing NFTs, providing users with true ownership and decentralized storage. They offer many services, but the main ones being:

Blockchain Technology
Smart Contracts
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
Decentralized Storage
Layer-2 Scaling Solutions
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

The backend of these platforms requires a lot of technology. Dapper Labs utilizes over 57 tools to build, market, and sell its products. Some of the languages and frameworks they use are Python, Solidity, C++, and Java. For development and collaboration, the company practices using Git and GitHub, along with a handful of other platforms. To see all technologies Dapper Labs employs please click here:

##### The Current Landscape #####

Over the last 5-10 years, the cryptocurrency and blockchain space has seen major developments, evolving from an obscure internet fad to the most powerful currency in the world. Dapper Labs found success in a subset of this new economy with the emergence and widespread adoption of NFTs. NFTs, representing ownership of unique digital assets, have found applications in various industries, with crypto gaming being a major use case. Pioneering projects like CryptoKitties demonstrated the potential of blockchain in gaming by introducing non-fungible, collectible, and tradable virtual assets on the Ethereum blockchain. 'CryptoGaming' offers an entirely new way for companies to interact with users. Play-to-earn models, where players can earn cryptocurrency rewards by actively participating in the game have gained popularity. Games like Axie Infinity pioneered this concept, allowing players to earn tokens through gameplay and contributing to the growth of the crypto gaming market. This is coupled with the development of smart contract platforms beyond Ethereum, such as Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and others that provide alternatives for developers with improved scalability and lower transaction costs.

Some of the other major players in the 'CryptoGaming' space include:

Axie Infinity: Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game where players can collect, breed, and battle fantasy creatures. Each Axie is a unique NFT with its own set of attributes and abilities that also affect the value. Axie Infinity introduced a groundbreaking play-to-earn model, allowing players to earn cryptocurrency rewards by participating in the game. Players can earn the in game cryptocurrency, known as Small Love Potion (SLP), by breeding, battling, they can then take the cryptocurrency sell it for USD or other fiat. 

The Sandbox: A virtual world and gaming platform that enables users to create, own, and monetize content using blockchain technology. The Sandbox emphasizes user-generated content, enabling users to create and customize their virtual environments, games, and experiences. This includes designing landscapes, constructing buildings, and scripting interactive elements. The Sandbox hosts events and social activities within its virtual world. Users can attend virtual concerts, art exhibitions, and other events, creating a dynamic and social environment.

##### Results/Recommendations #####

Dapper Labs has had a substantial impact on popularizing the concept of NFTs and blockchain-based collectibles. CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot have attracted a large user base, pioneering mainstream attention to the possibilities of blockchain technology in the gaming and entertainment industries. Core metrics for success in this domain include user engagement, transaction volume on the blockchain, the value of traded digital assets, and partnerships with established brands. Dapper Labs has shown strong performance in all of these metrics.

Dapper Labs has established itself as a leader in the blockchain gaming and NFT space, with its projects achieving widespread recognition and user adoption. The company has been wary of competition but has always had a significant competitive edge—known IP. Known IP offers a relatable way for consumers to digest the new world of cryptocurrency and blockchain platforms. A large portion of the population is still averse to the idea of cryptocurrency; however, if it were linked to their favorite movie or show, they are far more likely to pay attention. As the world heads towards decentralization, multibillion-dollar corporations are wondering how they are going to be integrated; Dapper Labs offers a way for these corporations not to get left behind, as is already beginning to be seen.

If I were advising this company, my main suggestion would be to keep acquiring IP to create games and dApps to create a more lively ecosystem on their FLOW blockchain network. For example, when they made NBA Top Shots, it was a massive success; however, this wouldn't have been possible without the licensing from the NBA. If they continue to create immersive games based on popular IP that allows consumers to make money through gameplay and user-friendly marketplaces, it would be the next major development in the gaming industry. They have continued this trajectory by releasing projects with the NFL/UFC and Disney. If they are able to secure partnerships in those two spaces by acquiring the licensing for sports events and Disney movies, those alone would make it hard for other companies to compete. Known IP also offers a sense of security due to the established trust with the brand; this is imperative because most people are unsure about spending their money on the blockchain. The services and products provided by a collaboration of popular IP and decentralization would employ all of the technology Dapper Labs is currently using, just on a larger scale. Languages such as Python and Solidity would be imperative to ensure that smart contracts and user experience are efficiently functioning.
